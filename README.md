Introduction
============

Pines Steps is a JavaScript notification plugin, developed by Angela Murrell as part of Pines. It is designed to provide an unparalleled level of flexibility, while still being very easy to implement and use.

See http://pinesframework.org/psteps/ for more information and examples.

Requirements
============

jQuery (1.X or higher) and Bootstrap.

Getting Started
===============

Pines Steps comes with the following files:

* `jquery.psteps.js` & `jquery.psteps.min.js` (Minified) - The main JavaScript.

So here's how you'd include them all:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.psteps.min.js"></script>

Now you can use Pines Steps like this:

	<script type="text/javascript">
	$(function(){
		$('#my_steps').psteps();
	});
	</script>

Configuration Defaults / Options
================================

* `option: default` - Description.
